        # We can't assert anything specific about its behavior since it does nothing.

            # If there's no Node.js environment or the file can't be directly executed,
            # this part needs to be adapted to use a mock or stub for the refactorCode function.

            # command = ["node", "-e", "require('./interface/index.js').refactorCode();"]
